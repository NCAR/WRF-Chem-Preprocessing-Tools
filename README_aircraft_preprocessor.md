# Aircraft emissions preprocessor

This is an IDL based preprocessor to create WRF-Chem ready aircraft emissions files (wrfchemaircraft_) from a global inventory in netcdf format. 
Please consult the README file for how to use the preprocessor. The emissions inventory is not included, so the user must provide their own.
