**weseley and exo_coldens**

The wesely utility, a single cpu code, reads WRF and Mozart
        input files and produces netcdf files, on a per WRF domain basis,
        containing overhead O2 and O3 column densities.  These files
        are only used for the WRF-chem MOZART and MOZCART chemistry options.
