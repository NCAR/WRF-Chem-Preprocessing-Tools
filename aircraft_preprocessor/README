Aircraft Emissions Preprocessor Tool

This IDL code reads the netcdf file baughcum_1999.aircraft.1x1.nc and interpolates emissions onto the WRF grid of interest. 

The "user modify" section is contained in lines 135-165. In this section, one defines where the wrfinput file and data file are located, 
the name of the domain (d01, d02, d03, etc), date (year, month, day), the time of day for the files (hourly output for 24 hours is the
current set up), and the maximum height of the anthropogenic emissions. This maximum height for anthropogenic emissions is needed because
the US EPA NEI contains aircraft emissions and therefore we set aircraft emissions in the output here to zero for heights below the maximum
height. 

Files created are named 'wrfaircraftchemi_'+domain+'_'+yyyy+'-'+mm+'-'+dd+'_'+hrs+':00:00'. In other words, the same naming protocol is used
as for wrfchemi files. 

The code is currently set up to create 24 files, one for each hour of day. If 2 12-hour files are desired, there are lines at the bottom of
the script that are commented out to show you how to combine the individual files into 2 12-hour files using nco commands. That is, 
/usr/bin/ncrcat wrfaircraftchemi_hour_0* wrfaircraftchemi_hour_10 wrfaircraftchemi_hour_11  wrfaircraftchemi_00z_d02
/usr/bin/ncrcat wrfaircraftchemi_hour_1[23456789] wrfaircraftchemi_hour_2* wrfaircraftchemi_12z_d01
